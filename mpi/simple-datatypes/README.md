## Using custom datatypes 

Write a program that sends the highlighted elements of a 2D array
using user defined datatypes from one MPI task to another. Note the
different assignments for C and Fortran, and remember that C stores
arrays in a row-major order and Fortran in a column-major order. You can
start from skeleton codes in [C](./c) or [Fortran](./fortran)
